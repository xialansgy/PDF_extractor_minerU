# ABSTRACT  

Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in solving complex tasks across diverse domains, typically by employing agentic workflows that follow detailed instructions and operational sequences. However, constructing these workflows requires significant human effort, limiting scalability and generalizability. Recent research has sought to automate the generation and optimization of these workflows, but existing methods still rely on initial manual setup and fall short of achieving fully automated and effective workflow generation. To address this challenge, we reformulate workflow optimization as a search problem over code-represented workflows, where LLM-invoking nodes are connected by edges. We introduce AFLOW, an automated framework that efficiently explores this space using Monte Carlo Tree Search, iteratively refining workflows through code modification, tree-structured experience, and execution feedback. Empirical evaluations across six benchmark datasets demonstrate AFLOW’s efficacy, yielding a $5.7\%$ average improvement over state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, AFLOW enables smaller models to outperform GPT-4o on specific tasks at $4.55\%$ of its inference cost in dollars. The code will be available at https://github.com/geekan/MetaGPT.  

# 1 INTRODUCTION  

Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for solving complex tasks across various domains, including code generation, data analysis, decision-making, and question answering (Liu et al., 2024; Li et al., 2024a; Zhu et al., 2024; Xie et al., 2024b; Sun et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024b; Song et al., 2023; Xie et al., 2024a; Zhong et al., 2024a). However, the rapid advancement of LLMs heavily relies on manually designed agentic workflows – structured sequences of LLM invocations accompanied by detailed instructions. Designing and refining these workflows requires significant human effort, which limits the scalability and adaptability of LLMs to new, complex domains and hinders their ability to transfer skills across diverse tasks (Tang et al., 2024).  

Recent efforts have focused on automating the discovery of effective agentic workflows to reduce the reliance on human intervention (Khattab et al., 2024; Yu¨ksekgo¨nu¨l et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2023; Hu et al., 2024). Despite these advancements, full automation has not been achieved. For instance, Khattab et al. (2024) requires manual workflow setup before automated prompt optimization. Similarly, methods proposed by Yu¨ksekgo¨nu¨l et al. (2024) and Zhuge et al. (2024) fail to capture the full diversity of workflows necessary for a wide range of tasks (Yu et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2024b; Sun et al., 2023), as their optimization objectives struggle to represent the breadth of possible workflows. The inability to effectively model diverse workflow structures within these automated systems limits their utility and impact. ADAS (Hu et al., 2024) represents workflows using code, achieving a relatively complete representation. However, due to the efficiency limitations of its linear heuristic search algorithm, ADAS struggles to generate effective workflows within a limited number of iterations. This highlights the need for more effective techniques to represent and automate the generation of agentic workflows, which would accelerate the application of LLMs across domains.

Figure 1: Performance comparison with other methods. To assess the method’s performance, we employ various metrics across different datasets: solve rate for Math and GSM8K, F1 score for HotpotQA and DROP, and pass $\ @1$ for HumanEval and MBPP. Our AFLOW (highlighted in yellow) consistently outperforms all automated workflow optimization and manually designed methods across all six benchmarks.  

In response to these challenges, we introduce an innovative framework for automatically generating agentic workflows. Our key idea is to model the workflow as a sequence of interconnected LLM-invoking nodes, where each node represents an LLM action and the edges define the logic, dependencies, and flow between these actions. This structure transforms the workflow into a vast search space, encompassing a wide variety of potential configurations. Our goal is to efficiently navigate this space, automatically generating optimized workflows that maximize task performance while minimizing human intervention.  

However, the diversity and complexity of tasks present significant challenges. Specifically, each task can have different requirements, operations, and dependencies, which makes it difficult to represent them in a unified yet flexible manner (Chen et al., 2021; Cobbe et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2018; Luo et al., 2018). Furthermore, the search space for possible workflows, comprising an immense number of code structures and node configurations, is virtually boundless, creating an additional challenge for efficient exploration and optimization.  

To address these challenges, we propose AFLOW, a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-based framework designed to systematically explore and discover optimal agentic workflows. AFLOW represents workflows as flexible nodes connected by code-based edges, which encapsulate possible relationships such as logical flows, conditions, and dependencies. These edges allow the workflow to be modeled as a graph (Zhuge et al., 2024) or network (Liu et al., 2023), offering a powerful structure for capturing complex interactions between LLM invocations.  

To enhance the search process and improve efficiency, AFLOW introduces a novel concept of operators – predefined, reusable combinations of nodes representing common agentic operations (e.g., Ensemble, Review & Revise). These operators serve as foundational building blocks for constructing workflows and are integrated into the search space, ensuring that the exploration process leverages known patterns of effective agentic operations.  

AFLOW employs the MCTS algorithm to navigate this infinite search space. The framework’s workflow optimization process incorporates several key innovations: a soft mixed-probability selection mechanism for node exploration, LLM-driven node expansion to introduce new possibilities, execution evaluation to assess workflow performance, and backpropagation of experience to refine future search iterations. This combination of techniques ensures that AFLOW efficiently discovers workflows that adapt to the complexity of diverse tasks while reducing reliance on manual intervention.  

We make the following key contributions:  

• Problem Formulation: We formalize the workflow optimization problem, generalizing prior approaches as specific cases. This provides a unified framework for future research at both the node and workflow optimization levels.   
• AFLOW: We introduce AFLOW, an MCTS-based method that automatically discovers effective workflows across multiple domains with minimal human intervention.   
• Extensive Evaluation: We evaluate AFLOW on six benchmark datasets: HumanEval, MBPP, MATH, GSM8K, HotPotQA, and DROP. AFLOW outperforms manually designed methods by $5.7\%$ and surpasses existing automated approaches by $19.5\%$ . Notably, workflows generated by AFLOW enable smaller LLMs to outperform larger models, offering better cost-performance efficiency, with significant implications for real-world applications.  

# 2 RELATED WORK  

Agentic Workflow. Agentic workflow and autonomous agents (Zhuge et al., 2023; Hong et al., 2024a; Zhang et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2023) represent two distinct paradigms of LLM application. The former completes tasks statically through predefined processes with multiple LLM invocations, while the latter solves problems dynamically through flexible autonomous decision-making. Compared to autonomous agents that require specific actions and decision patterns designed for the environment, agentic workflows can be constructed based on existing human domain experience and iterative refinement, offering higher potential for automated construction.  

Agentic workflows can be broadly categorized into general and domain-specific types. General workflows emphasize universal problem-solving approaches, such as (Wei et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022; Madaan et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2024a). Domain-specific workflows focus on building effective processes to solve domain-specific problems, such as code generation (Hong et al., 2024b; Ridnik et al., 2024; Zhong et al., 2024a), data analysis (Xie et al., 2024b; Ye et al., 2024; Li et al., 2024a; Zhou et al., 2023), mathematics (Zhong et al., 2024b; Xu et al., 2024), question answering (Nori et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2024a). Existing work has manually discovered numerous effective agentic workflows, but it’s challenging to exhaust various tasks across different domains, further highlighting the importance of automated workflow generation and optimization.  

Automated Agentic Optimization. Recent work aims to automate the design of agentic workflows, categorized into three types: automated prompt optimization, hyperparameter optimization, and automated workflow optimization. Prompt optimization (Fernando et al., 2024; Yu¨ksekgo¨nu¨l et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2024a; Khattab et al., 2024) uses LLMs to optimize prompts within fixed workflows. Hyperparameter optimization (Saad-Falcon et al., 2024) focuses on optimizing predefined parameters. While these approaches improve performance, they are limited in generalization to new tasks and often require moderate human effort for task-specific designs.  

Automated workflow optimization (Li et al., 2024b; Zhou et al., 2024b; Zhuge et al., 2024; Hu et al., 2024) aims to optimize entire workflow structures, offering more potential for fully automated generation. Recent works explore diverse representations and methods. GPTSwarm (Zhuge et al., 2024) uses graph structures with reinforcement learning, but struggles to represent workflows with conditional states due to graph structure limitations. ADAS (Hu et al., 2024) utilizes code structures to represent workflows and stores historical workflows in a linear list structure, aligning closely with our goals. However, it is constrained by the efficiency of its search algorithm as it relies on overly simplistic representations of experiences in the searching process, making it challenging to discover effective workflows.  

AFLOW also uses code to represent workflows, but goes further by providing a more fundamental structure called named node. This structure encompasses various LLM invocation parameters, allowing for more detailed workflow representation. We also introduce operators that implement predefined node combination functions. Simultaneously, AFLOW employs a specially designed MCTS algorithm for automated workflow optimization, leveraging the tree-structured experience and execution feedback to efficiently discover effective workflows.  

# 3 PRELIMINARY  

In this section, we will first formulate the automated agentic workflows generation problem in Section 3.1 and then discuss design considerations of our AFLOW in Section 3.2. For the core concept of this section, we provide an example explanation in Figure 2.  

![](images/e831e01916dd662679084a39138f0e65475429ff3425523a5f1478c225d3a961.jpg)

# 3.1 PROBLEM FORMULATION  

Agentic Workflow. We define an agentic workflow $W$ as a sequence of LLM-invoking nodes, denoted as $\mathcal{N}=\{N_{1},N_{2},...,N_{i}...\}$ . Each node $N_{i}$ represents a specific operation performed by an LLM and is characterized by the following parameters. The code abstraction of the node is shown in Appendix A.2.  

• Model $M$ : The specific language model invoked at node $N_{i}$ .   
• Prompt $P$ : The input or task description provided to the model at each node.   
• Temperature $\tau$ : A parameter controlling the randomness of the LLM’s output at node $N_{i}$ .   
• Output format $F$ : The format in which the model’s output is structured (e.g., xml, json, markdown, raw). The node in workflow should provide different output formats, inspired by the Tam et al. (2024).  

These nodes are connected by edges $E$ , which represent the connection between the nodes, governing the sequence of execution. The edges $E$ can represent various structures, such as:  

• Graph Zhuge et al. (2024): A flexible structure representing hierarchical, sequential, or parallel relationships between nodes, allowing for complex branching workflows.   
• Neural Network (Liu et al., 2023): A structure that can represent complex, non-linear relationships between nodes, allowing for adaptive and learnable workflows based on input and feedback.   
• Code (Hu et al., 2024): A comprehensive representation that can express linear sequences, conditional logic, loops, and incorporate graph or network structures, offering the most precise control over workflow execution.  

Automated Workflow Optimization. Given a task $T$ and an evaluation function $G$ , the goal of workflow optimization is to discover a workflow $W$ that maximizes $G(W,T)$ . This can be formulated as a search process where an algorithm $A$ explores the search space $s$ to determine the optimal workflow configuration. The search space $s$ for a workflow optimization problem encompasses all possible configurations of node parameters and edge structures:  

$$
{\mathcal{S}}=\{({\mathcal{N}},E)\mid E\in{\mathcal{E}}\},
$$  

where $\mathcal{N}=\{N(M,\tau,P,F)\mid M\in\mathcal{M},\tau\in[0,1],P\in\mathcal{P},F\in\mathcal{F}\}.$ , with $\mathcal{M},\mathcal{P},\mathcal{F},\mathcal{E}$ representing the sets of possible language models, prompts, output formats, and edge configurations, respectively.  

![](images/a205a6595772db54945ac06b99008904882f48d7f051ffedbe7acbd49a4848da.jpg)  
Figure 3: Overall AFLOW framework: By setting a search space composed of nodes with only prompt parameters flexible, a given operator set, and a code representing edge, AFLOW performs an MCTS-based search within this space. Through a variant of MCTS designed for workflow optimization, AFLOW iteratively executes a cycle of Soft Mixed Probability Selection, LLM-Based Expansion, Execution Evaluation, and Experience Backpropagation until reaching the maximum number of iterations or meeting convergence criteria.  

With this formulation, the workflow optimization problem can be expressed as:  

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{W=A({\cal S},{\cal G},{\cal T}),}}\\ {{W^{\ast}=\underset{W\in{\cal S}}{\arg\operatorname*{max}}{\cal G}(W,{\cal T}),}}\end{array}
$$  

where $A$ is the search algorithm that explores the search space $s$ , and $W^{*}$ is the optimal workflow configuration that maximizes the evaluation function $G$ for the given task $T$ .  

# 3.2 AFLOW OVERVIEW  

Limitations of Previous Methods. Previous approaches Yu¨ksekgo¨nu¨l et al. (2024); Khattab et al. (2024); Zhuge et al. (2024) to workflow optimization have primarily been constrained by the limited scope of their search spaces, based on problem definition in Section 3.1. Another related work, ADAS (Hu et al., 2024), searches in a larger space comprising a combination of prompts $N(P,T)$ and edges $E$ , but fails to discover effective workflows due to the efficiency limitations of its linear heuristic search algorithm.  

Formulation. To address the limitations of previous methods, we propose AFLOW, a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as optimizers within a variant of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to search for optimal workflows. By representing nodes $N$ and edges $E$ through code, AFLOW can explore the full range of possible agentic workflows, ensuring completeness in the search space. Specifically, as shown in Figure 3, AFLOW uses a variant of MCTS to iteratively explore the workflow search space, evaluate different configurations, and backpropagate experiences to refine the workflow optimization process.  

To enhance search efficiency in practice, we simplify the search space by fixing key parameters such as the model $M$ , temperature $\tau$ , and format $F$ . This simplification allows AFLOW to focus its search primarily on the code-represented edges $E$ and prompts. To navigate this still vast search space effectively, we introduce the concept of Operators. These Operators encapsulate common agentic operations (e.g., Ensemble, Review, Revise) by combining $N$ and $E$ into unified interfaces, thereby enabling more efficient utilization by AFLOW. By employing these Operators, we achieve more efficient search and streamlined workflow generation.

Given a set of operators $\mathcal{O}$ , the optimization problem can be formalized as:  

$$
\begin{array}{r l}&{\mathcal{S}_{\mathrm{AFlow}}=\{(P_{1},\dots,P_{n},E,O_{1},\dots,O_{n})\mid P_{i}\in\mathcal{P},E\in\mathcal{E},O_{i}\in\mathcal{O}\}}\\ &{}\\ &{\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad W^{*}=\mathrm{AFLow}(\mathcal{S}_{\mathrm{AFlow}},G,T)}\end{array}
$$  

Tasks Scope and Operations. In this paper, we focus on applying AFLOW to reasoning tasks with easily obtainable evaluation functions.  

We extract common operations from existing literature and define them as part of the operator set $\mathcal{O}$ . These operations include: (1) Generate, (2) Format, (3) Review and Revise Madaan et al. (2023), (4) Ensemble Wang et al. (2022), (5) Test Zhong et al. (2024a), and (6) Programmer. The operator set $\mathcal{O}$ can be easily expanded to enhance search efficiency for various tasks. Alternatively, AFLOW can perform searches with an empty Operator Set, offering flexibility in implementation. The efficiency comparison between these approaches is detailed in Section 5.2. For a comprehensive understanding of the operators, we provide their detailed structures in Appendix A.4.  

# 4 THE DESIGN DETAILS OF AFLOW  

The core concept of the AFLOW is to employ Large Language Models (LLMs) as optimizers to modify code-represented workflows within a search structure based on a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) variant. It operates through an iterative process of soft mixed probability selection, LLMbased optimization expansion, execution evaluation, experience backpropagation, and dynamic convergence assessment until reaching maximum iterations or meets convergence criteria. A simplified illustration is shown in Figure 3, with a detailed algorithm process presented in Appendix 1.  

Existing workflow optimization methods iteratively use past workflow structures to prompt LLMs to discover new structures. However, due to information loss during accumulation (as input tokens increase), this approach struggles to guide LLMs towards specific performance metrics. Combined with the vast search space of code, this reduces search efficiency. Our key idea is to leverage the tree structure of MCTS to preserve node-based exploration experiences in workflow optimization. When a node is revisited, we accurately reuse past successful experiences and avoid failures, enabling effective workflow generation and improving search efficiency. To prevent local optima, we introduce a special selection mechanism allowing generation from a blank template at any round. Next, we will introduce the complete process of AFLOW, as shown in Algorithm 1.  

Initialization. AFLOW begins with a template workflow, which provides a framework for invoking nodes and operators. The code template, detailed in Appendix A.3, allows the LLM optimizer to complete workflow simply by completing call functions. Prior to initiating the search process, we randomly partition the dataset into a validation set $(20\%)$ and a test set $(80\%)$ , with the random seed fixed at 42. To optimize computational efficiency, AFLOW then executes the blank template five times on the validation dataset. From these executions, we select a subset of problems that exhibit high variance in scores, which becomes the final validation set.  

Selection. Our algorithm forms the initial node by evaluating an empty workflow on the validation set, which is distinct from the root node in MCTS as it can be selected across different depths. And then continuously select workflows based on a soft mixed probability selection strategy. We propose this strategy for large search spaces like workflow optimization, combining uniform probability distribution with score-based weighted probability distribution to select from candidate nodes composed of score-prioritized top- $\mathbf{\nabla}\cdot\mathbf{k}$ nodes and the initial node, ensuring a balance between exploration and exploitation, avoiding local optima. The formula for this selection strategy is as follows:  

$$
P_{\mathrm{mixed}}(i)=\lambda\cdot{\frac{1}{n}}+(1-\lambda)\cdot{\frac{\exp(\alpha\cdot(s_{i}-s_{\operatorname*{max}}))}{\sum_{j=1}^{n}\exp(\alpha\cdot(s_{j}-s_{\operatorname*{max}}))}}
$$  

Where $n$ is the number of candidate nodes, $s_{i}$ is the score of node $(i),s_{\mathrm{max}}$ is the maximum score, $\alpha$ controls the influence of scores, and $\lambda$ balances uniform and weighted probabilities.  

Expansion. In the expansion phase, we employ an LLM as an optimizer to create new workflows and the optimize prompt is illustrated in Appendix A.1. The optimizer leverages the selected workflow’s experience to generate new prompts or modify node connections by altering code, resulting in new workflows. Specifically, to maximally uncover insights from past iterations, the experience includes all modifications and their corresponding improvements or failures on the selected workflow, along with precise logs of predictions and expected output.  

Evaluation. AFLOW directly executes workflows to get feedback due to explicit evaluation functions in reasoning tasks. We test each generated workflow 5 times on the validation set, computing mean and standard deviation. While this increases per-iteration cost, it provides more accurate feedback for the optimizer. This precision enhances search efficiency, ultimately reducing the number of iterations required to reach an effective solution.  

Backpropagation. After execution, the workflow’s performance is obtained. This information, along with the optimizer’s modification of its parent workflow and whether it successfully optimized relative to its parent, is stored in the experience. This experience is propagated back to the parent workflow. Simultaneously, the performance score is added to the global performance record, providing a basis for the selection phase.  

Terminal Condition. To avoid unnecessary costs from continued execution after optimization reaches its limit, we design a simple early stopping mechanism. The iteration stops when the average of the score-prioritized top- $\mathbf{\nabla}\cdot\mathbf{k}$ shows no improvement for $n$ consecutive rounds. If this mechanism is not triggered, the process completes after the full $N$ rounds. The details of the whole algorithm can be found in Appendix 1.  

# 5 EXPERIMENTS  

# 5.1 EXPERIMENTAL SETUP  

Datasets. We utilized six public benchmarks for our experiments. Following established practices (Saad-Falcon et al., 2024; Hu et al., 2024) in workflow optimization, we divide the data into validation and test sets using a 1:4 ratio. Specifically, we use the full datasets for GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021), HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021), and MBPP (Austin et al., 2021). For HotpotQA (Yang et al., 2018) and DROP (Dua et al., 2019), we randomly select 1,000 samples each, in line with (Hu et al., 2024; Shinn et al., 2023). For the MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021) dataset, we follow (Hong et al., 2024a) in selecting 617 problems from four typical problem types (Combinatorics & Probability, Number Theory, Pre-algebra, Pre-calculus) at difficulty level 5.

Baselines. We compare workflow discovered by AFLOW against manually designed methods for LLMs, including IO (direct LLM invocation), Chain-of-Thought (Wei et al., 2022), Self Consistency CoT (5 answers) (Wang et al., 2022), MultiPersona Debate (Wang et al., 2024a), Self-Refine (max 3 iteration rounds) (Madaan et al., 2023), and MedPrompt (3 answers and 5 votes) (Nori et al., 2023). We also compared against workflow designed by automated workflow optimization method ADAS (Hu et al., 2024).  

Implementation Details. AFLOW utilizes different models for optimization and execution. We employ Claude-3.5-sonnet (Anthropic, 2024) as the optimizer and use models: DeepSeekV2.5 (Deepseek, 2024), GPT-4o-mini-0718 (OpenAI, 2024b), Claude-3.5-sonnet-0620 (Anthropic, 2024), GPT-4o-0513 (OpenAI, 2024a)) as executors. All models are accessed via APIs. We set the temperature to 1 for DeepSeek-V2.5 and to 0 for the other models. We set iteration rounds to 20 for AFLOW. For ADAS, we use Claude-3.5-sonnet as the optimizer and GPT-4o-mini as the executor, with the iteration rounds set to 30.  

Metrics. For GSM8K and $\mathbf{MATH}_{l v5^{*}}$ , we report the Solve Rate $(\%)$ as the primary metric. For HumanEval and MBPP, we report the pass $\ @1$ metric as presented in (Chen et al., 2021) to assess code accuracy. For HotpotQA and DROP, we report the F1 Score. Additionally, for all datasets, we calculate the cost by tracking token usage to construct a pareto front, visually demonstrating the performance-cost trade-offs between different methods.  

# 5.2 EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND ANALYSIS  

Main Results. The main experimental results, as shown in Table 1, demonstrate the effectiveness of AFLOW. Workflows optimized by AFLOW outperform all manually designed methods by an average of $5.7\%$ and surpass contemporary automated workflow optimization work by $19.5\%$ . Across six datasets in QA, Code, and Math domains, AFLOW achieves an average performance of $80.3\%$ , marking the capability and usability of this method.

The colors in the legend represent the LLM used to execute each workflow in test dataset. The specific numerical values for this Figure can be found in Appendix D.  

To explore whether the workflow searched by AFLOW is model-agnostic, we use GPT-4o-mini and DeepSeek-V2.5 as execution LLMs to search effective workflows with different structures, with the results illustrated in Table 2. When applying these workflows to other models, the vast majority demonstrate stronger performance than the baseline, showcasing the generalizability of the workflows discovered by AFLOW. Simultaneously, we observe that the workflow identified using DeepSeek-V2.5 performs notably weaker on GPT-4o-mini compared to the workflow found using GPT-4o-mini itself. This suggests that different language models require different workflows to achieve their optimal performance.  

Cost Analysis. We demonstrate the comparison of performance and cost between the baselines and the top three workflows found by AFLOW using GPT-4o-mini and DeepSeek-V2.5 as execution LLMs. The comparison is made across four models with different capabilities and price points. Results demonstrate that AFLOW can identify workflows that allow weaker models to outperform stronger models on the pareto front of cost-effectiveness. This breakthrough effectively removes barriers to the widespread application of agentic workflows across various domains. By automating the design of effective agentic workflows, AFLOW eliminates the human labor costs previously required. Moreover, the ability to achieve superior performance at lower costs compared to stronger models opens up further possibilities for widespread adoption.  

Ablation Study. To enhance search efficiency, we introduce operators into the search space, which can be viewed as a form of human design. To explore AFLOW’s performance with zero human intervention, we conducted an ablation study on the GSM8K dataset. Results shown in Figure 5 demonstrate that AFLOW with operators discover better-performing workflows within the same number of iterations, exhibiting a trend of multiple small improvements. This indicates that operators effectively boost search efficiency by introducing a constrained search space. Even without operators, AFLOW still achieves $93.1\%$ performance, surpassing other manually designed methods. Notably, in the experiment without operators, AFLOW autonomously develops a structure similar to the ensemble. This demonstrates its advantage as an optimizer for searching code-represented edges, enabling it to independently design efficient structures for problems, thereby taking a significant step towards fully automated workflow optimization. Details is shown in Appendix B.  

Case Study. AFLOW demonstrates a clear iteration process, as shown in Figure 6, illustrating how it evolves from a blank template (containing only a single Node without prompts) to the structure presented in Figure 5(B). In each iteration, AFLOW employs a single-step modification, meaning it either adds one operator (rounds 2, 3) or makes a targeted modification to a prompt (rounds 8, 10). Among the unsuccessful exploration nodes, AFLOW introduced a custom review node that directly modified answers generated through complex processes without additional reasoning (round 5), which decreased accuracy. In round 14, AFLOW attempted to rephrase the problem but overly focused on ’discount’ information, leading to a decrease in accuracy. This iteration process showcases how tree-based search allows AFLOW to further optimize known paths while retaining the ability to explore new ones. In iterations on other datasets, AFLOW discovered structures similar to current manually designed workflows. For instance, on the MBPP dataset, it explored a process where an LLM generates tests and then executes them, aligning with the approach in Ridnik et al. (2024). The workflow and more discovered results are presented in Appendix B and a complete optimization process is presented in Appendix C.

Figure 5: (A) Comparison of highest performance curves on GSM8K for both validation and test sets generated by AFLOW with and without operators. Compared to other datasets, GSM8K has a larger data volume, meaning that the same percentage improvement represents a greater increase in correctly solved samples, avoiding fluctuations in improvement due to small data size that could affect comparisons; (B): The code for the best-performing workflow discovered by AFLOW on the GSM8K dataset.  

# 6 CONCLUSION  

This paper has introduced AFLOW, a novel framework for automated workflow optimization. We have comprehensively formulated the automated workflow optimization problem, establishing a foundational structure for future research. AFLOW has leveraged Monte Carlo Tree Search and code-represented workflows to navigate the vast search space of possible workflows efficiently. Our experiments across six benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of AFLOW, which has outperformed manually designed methods and existing automated optimization approaches. Ablation studies have shown that AFLOW can autonomously discover effective structures, even without predefined operators. Importantly, AFLOW has enabled weaker models to outperform stronger ones on the Pareto front of cost-effectiveness, potentially revolutionizing the adoption of agentic workflows across various domains. These results have highlighted AFLOW’s potential for enhancing LLMs’ problem-solving capabilities while optimizing computational costs.

Providing predefined operators can effectively enhance the search efficiency of AFLOW. We implement six common operator structures, including: Generate (Contextual, Code), Format, Review & Revise, Ensemble, Test, and Programmer. For the Test Operator, we use the public test dataset of the dataset as test data. For datasets like MBPP that don’t provide a public test dataset, we follow the setting in Zhong et al. (2024a) where we use the first test case of each problem as public test data.

AFLOW demonstrates its ability to reduce human effort by evolving from an empty workflow to a solution highly similar to manually designed workflows like Ridnik et al. (2024) in the code generation scenario. This showcases AFLOW’s capability to generate efficient workflows comparable to expert designs with minimal human intervention.

This optimal workflow generated for the MATH task showcases the model’s ability to generate complex, task-specific solutions from task-agnostic initial settings. It combines programmatic solutions with various reasoning strategies, culminating in an ensemble selection process, and spontaneously formats the answer into the required form. This adaptation demonstrates the model’s flexibility in tailoring workflows to different problem domains, while maintaining sophisticated problem-solving structures.

The optimal workflow generated for the MBPP task simply combines operators with an ingenious FIX-CODE PROMPT, achieving the optimal workflow in the iteration at the fourteenth round. Although this workflow is simple, its score is extremely high and stable, demonstrating AFLOW’s potential to find the optimal cost-performance balance.  

# The optimal workflow generated for HotpotQA  

![](images/a73c16814ec1179aa20096bad06c59b5c37e3eaab1fe9d344cfa918b487ade33.jpg)  

The optimal workflow generated for the HotpotQA task demonstrates the effectiveness of execution feedback. Apart from logical reasoning, another factor affecting QA problem scores is effective formatting. AFLOW can effectively identify the correct format and automatically perform formatting through learning from execution feedback, showcasing the efficacy of this design.  

# An ensemble structure that emerged in the GSM8K ablation experiment

In the ablation study, where predefined operators were deliberately removed, AFLOW surprisingly developed this simplified yet effective workflow. Most notably, it independently evolved an ensemble-like operator, mirroring a key aspect of the optimal workflow. This emergence of a multisolution generation and selection process, despite reduced guidance, highlights AFLOW’s inherent tendency towards robust problem-solving strategies. The spontaneous development of this ensemble approach in a constrained environment underscores AFLOW’s ability to identify and implement effective techniques, even when operating with limited resources or instructions. This unexpected convergence between the ablated and optimal workflows further demonstrates AFLOW’s capacity for developing sophisticated, human-like problem-solving paradigms across different experimental conditions.

When designing workflows, ADAS incorporates all workflows from the search history into the prompt, distinguishing them only by their generation order and scores. However, the complex information embedded in the intricate structure of workflows, coupled with the accumulation of search iterations, the vast amount of information, and the continuously accumulating irrelevant information, poses significant challenges for LLM reasoning. ADAS stores experience from previous searches at the coarsest granularity—directly storing all complete workflows. This approach causes the LLM designing workflows in ADAS to behave more like an explorer of infinite possibilities within $\mathcal{E}$ rather than a designer seeking the optimal workflow.  

As shown in the code in Appendix B.2, the optimal workflow discovered by ADAS assigns diverse roles and multiple steps for refinement and summarization. However, for multi-hop reasoning tasks, the correct approach is to continuously reduce the problem scale to single-hop reasoning. Contrary to this, ADAS’s optimal workflow actually increases the problem scale, ultimately attempting to use the LLM’s summarization ability to synthesize information, rather than gradually reducing the number of hops based on the characteristics of multi-hop reasoning scenarios.
